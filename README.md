# SDL-Pong
A simple pong game written in c++ using the SDL library
<br>
<br>
Controls:
<br>
  Left paddle up:    W
<br>
  Left paddle down:  D
<br>
  Right paddle up:   ↑
<br>
  Right paddle down: ↓
<br>
  Exit:              Esc
<br>
<br>
<br>
  On windows use build.bat to build
  On linux cd into the install directory and type "make"
<br>
<br>
Note: You must have the SDL2 library installed along with SDL_Image and SDL_ttf for both windows and linux.
Note: both build.sh and the unix make file are made for the gcc and g++ compilers but you could easilly compile them with other compilers manually (there's only one file!)
